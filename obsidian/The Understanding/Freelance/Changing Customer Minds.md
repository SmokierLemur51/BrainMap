### Old site got hacked

Thinking about what kind of packet that I could put together to present in person to someone who this has happened to.

- Things I could include
	1. Certificates, sec+, CCNA.
	2. Technology stack, as well as scrapers that show known vulnerabilities.
	3. Hacking tools and regular pen-testing.
