#### z = f(x, y)

To calculate a line between two points in a three dimensional graph, use the point-slope form of the equation using the points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2):
(x - x1) / (x2 - x1) = (y - y1) / (y2 - y1) = (z - z1) / (z2 - z1)

Here's a step-by-step example of how to calculate the line equation between two points

Let's say we have two points A(1, 2, 3) and B(4, 5, 6):

Step 1: Find the direction vector (B - A):

Direction vector = B - A = (4 - 1, 5 - 2, 6 - 3) = (3, 3, 3)

Step 2: Write the vector equation using point A:

r(t) = A + t * Direction vector r(t) = (1, 2, 3) + t * (3, 3, 3)

This is the vector equation of the line passing through points A and B.
